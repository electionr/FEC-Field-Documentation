    GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
FORM TYPE
	FORM TYPE  refers to the combination of the FEC form and other important identifying indicators.  For the general forms the format is form type, amendment indicator i.e.:  F3A, F3PN.  The Amendment Y/N check boxes will be “Yes” if  the ‘A’ indicator is included in the Form Type - otherwise they will be assumed to be “No”.  If the Report Type is indicated as a “Termination Report”, a ‘T’ indicator will be included in the Form Type (for quick identification purposes) UNLESS the ‘A’ amendment indicator supersedes the ‘T’ indicator.
More complicated are form types from the schedules, which indicate the schedule (SA) and the line from the core form that the record relates to (i.e. SA15A).

FEC ID NUMBER - FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER, FEC CANDIDATE ID NUMBER
	All references to “FEC ID NUMBER” indicate that the field contains a FEC assigned identification number.  All committee ID numbers begin with a ‘C’ and all candidate ID numbers begin with: S (senate), H (house), P (presidential).  All FEC id numbers are 9 characters long with no spaces.

This document has been changed to include more detail and to insure consistency.
	For example, in Form 1, the line:
2.   ID NUMBER	 FEC ID NUMBER		(A/N-9)
	has been changed to:
2.   FILER FEC CMTE ID				(A/N-9)
 (which reflects that only committees will file the document.)

Please note, certain lines will have identifying words included; these exist only to aid in identifying the type of committee included in the field.  For example:
2.  FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER (PCC)	(A/N-9)
9.  FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER (ACCOUNT)	(A/N-9)

COMMITTEE NAME - COMMITTEE NAME
All committee names are a maximum of 90 characters long.

ORGANIZATION TYPE - ORGANIZATION TYPE
The FEC interest group codes match the boxes on the form exactly.  Options are: ‘C’, ‘T’, ‘L’, ‘M’, ‘V’, ‘W’.  See Appendix.

CANDIDATE NAME - CANDIDATE NAME
All candidate names are a maximum of 38 characters long.

STREET ADDRESS 1/2 - STREET 1, STREET 2
All street addresses are a maximum of 34 characters long.
If only one line of street address is given, it should be coded in Street 1, and Street 2 should be blank.

CITY - CITY
All city indicators are a maximum of 18 characters long.

STATE CODE - STATE / ELECTION STATE
All state indicators are 2 character codes.  The Appendix includes a listing of  special state codes.  State codes referring to addresses are indicated by STATE, references to the state in which a candidate is running are referred to as ELECTION STATE. 

ZIP CODE - ZIP
All zip codes are 9 characters long, four trailing spaces are acceptable.

DATES - DATE
All dates are eight numeric characters.  The dates are in the format CCYYMMDD.  In this text many dates are followed by identifiers such as:  DATE (OF CONTRIBUTION).   However, implementation of the “Header Record” allows for the specification of dates in either CCYYMMDD or MMDDCCYY formats.

AMOUNTS
Amount fields are 12 characters maximum.  They must be numeric (with two exceptions).  A leading minus (-) sign is used to indicate negative amount values.  An explicit decimal point (.) must be imbedded with 2 numeric decimal positions following the point.  However, implementation of the “Header Record”  allows for the specification of amounts with either explicit decimal point (e.g. 999.99, 0.05, -100.00) representation,  or “implicit” decimal representation (e.g. 99999, 005, -10000).  With implicit decimal  point representation, the last two (2) digits are interpreted to be cents.

RATES
Interest rates are generally coded as numeric amounts, however up to 15 characters of text is acceptable.  Rates can be expressed in terms such as “Prime + 1%” for example.  If the rate is expressed as a percentage then it must be coded as a 4-digit percent (i.e. 4 decimal places with/without an explicit decimal point).  For example: .0500 or 0865 are interpreted as 5% or 8.65%.
The maximum field length for “text” rates is 15 bytes.
The maximum field length for numeric rates is 5 bytes

INDIVIDUAL’S NAMES - IND/NAME
All individual names are a maximum of 38 characters.  
To accommodate the variety of situations, the following has been implemented for the name field. Each name field may contain the following elements:
	Lastname (or Business name)
	Firstname (plus all middle initials and/or middle names)
	Prefix (such as Dr., Ms. or Mr.)
	Suffix (such as Jr., Sr.)
Accordingly, the name field is sub-delimited with a carrot (^) so that a name field record would appear as follows:
	“Lastname^Firstname^Prefix^Suffix”
Some examples follow:
	Dr. John W. Smith, Jr. would be shown as: “Smith^John W.^Dr.^Jr.”
	Smith Medical Corporation would be: “Smith Medical Corporation”
	Ms. Jennifer T. Smith-Reilly would be “Smith-Reilly^Jennifer T.^Ms.”

INDIVIDUAL’S EMPLOYER - INDEMP
All individual employers fields are now a maximum of 38 characters. 

INDIVIDUAL’S OCCUPATION - INDOCC
Previously in this document the individual occupation field was listed at 34 characters.  It has been changed  so that all individual occupation fields are now a maximum of 38 characters.  The original logic was that the disclosure database contains 35 character names.

CANDIDATE OFFICE - CAN/OFF
The candidate office field is a one character alpha code;  ‘H’ represents house, ‘S’ represents senate, and ‘P’ represents presidential. 

CANDIDATE DISTRICT - CAN/DIST
Candidate districts consist of two numeric characters.  The only acceptable responses are
blank, and 00 through 99.


PARTY DESIGNATIONS - PTY/CODE
Candidates and some committees declare their party affiliations.  This should be a three character code and is optional in all cases.  A full list of these party codes is included in the Appendix.

TITLE - TITLE
All titles are a maximum of 20 characters long.

TELEPHONE NUMBER - TELEPHONE
Telephone numbers, when reported contain 10 numeric characters.

REPORT CODE - RPTCODE
Report code consists of  three alpha-numeric characters.  The acceptable report codes are included in the Appendix. 

ELECTION TYPE (REPORTS) - RPTPGI
Election types, when referring to the basic reports, can only indicate elections within the election cycle that is being reported.  Therefore the only acceptable responses are: ‘C’, ‘G’, ‘P’, ‘R’, ‘S’.  A full list of these codes is listed in the Appendix. 

ELECTION TYPE (ITEMIZED) - ITEM-ELECT-CD
In reference to the individual transactions reported on the various schedules, election types indicate elections within the election cycle that is being reported and past and future elections.   See Appendix.
If Other is coded, the ITEM-ELECT-OTHER description must also be coded.

CONVENTION COMMITTEE TYPE -CONVENTION TYPE
Form 4 gives a selection for type of convention committee.  The choices are: Arrangements, Host and Other.  Included is a 40 character area for a description of the “Other”.

SEQUENCE NUMBER - SEQUENCE NUMBER
In the schedules the format calls for a user generated sequence number, this number is to be used to identify transactions especially for amendments.

COMMUNICATION COSTS SUPPORT/OPPOSE - 24F24N
Communication costs may be reported on Form 7.   The support/oppose difference is identified as 24F and 24N, these being the only acceptable entries in the field.  Data is represented by an ‘S’ or an ‘O’.  Data translation is done by equating ‘S’ with ‘24F’ and  ‘O’ with ‘24N’.

INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES SUPPORT/OPPOSE - 24A24E
Communication costs may be reported on Schedule E and Form 5.   The  support/oppose difference is identified as 24A and 24E, these being the only acceptable entries in the field.  Data is represented by an ‘S’ or an ‘O’.  Data translation is done by equating ‘S’ with ‘24E’ and ‘O’ with ‘24A’.

TYPE OF RECEIPT - RECEIPTCODE 
Schedule SA’s layout contains both a receipt code field, where ‘P’=Primary, ‘G’=General, and ‘O’=Other, and a transaction description field.  One or the other of the fields are optional, however one must be entered.  The transaction may further be described in the Memo field.

TYPE OF DISBURSEMENT - DISBURSECODE
Schedule SB’s layout contains both a disbursement code field, where ‘P’=Primary, ‘G’=General and ‘O’=Other, and a transaction description field.  One or the other of the fields are optional however one must be entered.  The transaction may further described in the Memo field.

PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION - TRANSDESC
A description of  itemized transactions, with a maximum of 40 characters.  
DESCRIPTION FIELD - DESC
There are many general text fields that are required throughout these forms and Schedules.  Many are in response to the YESNO (below) questions on the forms.  The DESC fields range from 20 to 300 maximum characters.

MEMO ENTRY- MEMO
Many  itemized transactions have a Memo entry to allow the filers to provide a more complete description of the activity.  Maximum 100 characters.  Memo Text is available on itemized amounts on Schedules A and B - amounts which are totaled and carried back to the Summary Page of the filing.  In addition a Memo Code indicates that the amount is NOT to be included in the itemization total.

YES/NO BOXES - YESNO
Several Forms and Schedules contain yes/no boxes, the questions are generally different for each form and can determine the need for further response in another field.  Unless otherwise noted, Check Boxes are evaluated to be “checked” or “empty” based on the data content of the related field in the Comma-Separated-Value (CSV) file.
Box = “Checked” when CSV value is ‘X’, ‘Y’, ‘1’ or ‘T’ (value ‘X’ is preferred)
Box = “Empty” when CSV value is blank, ‘N’, ‘0’ or ‘F’    (space or null is preferred)

AMENDED RECORD - AMENDED
Each applicable schedule contains an “Amended” field. This field is to be used to indicate which records constitute “amended” records.
Values:	‘A’=New (Added) Record, ‘C’=Changed Record, and ‘D’=Deleted Record.

For example if the contribution is not for this year’s Primary, General, Special, or Runoff election, the ITEM-ELECT-OTHER field should contain descriptive text such as: “Debt 19xx”.

	Field 17. TRANS-CODE represents FEC transaction codes.  This field is optional, but if left blank the transaction MUST be described in field 189.  TRANS-DESCRIP, and further explained in field 32.  MEMO-TEXT, if necessary. (Trans-Code & Trans-descrip serve the same purpose as “Purpose of Disbursement” on Schedule B.)

	Field 16. AMOUNT-RECEIVED is included in the Schedule A Column A Summary Total, UNLESS 31. MEMO-CODE is also “Checked”.

	If another Federal committee is involved in the transactions, (i.e. Entity-Type = ‘PAC’, ‘COM’, ‘CCM’, or ‘PPO’), the 19. FEC-COMMITTEE-ID-NUMBER should be supplied (if known).

	If the committee making the contribution is a committee “authorized” by a candidate (ie. Entity-Type= ‘CCM’ and field 20. FEC-CANDIDATE-ID-NUMBER is left blank, candidate information (Name, Office, State, House District) must be entered.  (Note: Candidate District only applies to Congressional or “House” (Cand-Office + ‘H’) candidates.)	

	If 31. MEMO-CODE is “checked”, then the AMOUNT-RECEIVED is NOT counted on the Schedule A total that is carried back to the Summary Page.

	34.TRAN-ID is Required for all Schedule A transactions.  It is a unique database code assigned by the filer database to each and every item.  The TRAN-ID is used by the FEC’s database to uniquely identify any itemization that must be changed if a future amendment has an impact on that particular item.  Currently, TRAN-ID is required for Original transactions and “Add” amendments (i.e. Amend-Cd=blank or ‘A’) and is optional when Amend-Cd = ‘C’ or ‘D’. 

	35.ORIG-TRAN-ID is Required if Amended-Cd =‘C’ or “D’.  It contains the Tran-ID of the “original” transaction that will be changed or deleted from FEC database.  It is Optional for Original and Add (Amended-Cd=‘A”) transactions, but, if given, must equal the Tran-ID.

	36.SUPR-TRAN-ID Currently this is an Optional field.  If Amended-Cd= ‘C’ or ‘D’, this field contains the Tran_ID of the most recent transaction reported to the FEC database.  It either points to the Original (if no amendments) or to the most recent Amending transactions that is to be “superseded” by this transaction.

	Note: To assure future compatibility with FEC electronic filing requirements, it is recommended that TRAN_ID always contains a unique transaction identifier (on all Original and Amending transactions), and that SUPR-TRAN-ID is used on all Change/Delete Amendments.
