FORM TYPE
	FORM TYPE  refers to the combination of the FEC form and other important identifying indicators.  For the general forms the format is form type, amendment indicator i.e.:  F3A, F3PN.  The Amendment Y/N check boxes will be “Yes” if  the “A” indicator is included in the Form Type - otherwise they will be assumed to be “No”.  If the Report
Type is indicated as a “Termination Report”, a “T” indicator will be included in the Form
Type (for quick identification purposes) UNLESS the “A” amendment indicator supersedes the “T” indicator.

	More complicated are form types from the schedules which indicate the schedule (SA) and the line from the core form that the record relates to i.e.,  SA15A.


FEC ID NUMBER - FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER, FEC CANDIDATE ID NUMBER
	All references to “FEC ID NUMBER” indicates that the field contains a FEC assigned identification number.  All committee ID numbers begin with a “C” and all candidate ID numbers begin with: S (senate), H (house), P	(presidential).  All FEC id numbers are 9 characters long with no spaces.

This document has been changed to include more detail and to insure consistency.
	For example, in Form 1, the line:
2.   ID NUMBER	FEC ID NUMBER		(A/N-9)
	has been changed to:
2.   FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER		(A/N-9)
 reflect that only committees will file the document.

Please note, certain lines will have identifying words included; these exist only to aid in identifying the type of committee included in the field.  For example:
2.  FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER (PCC)		(A/N-9)
9.  FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER (ACCOUNT)		(A/N-9)

COMMITTEE NAME - COMMITTEE NAME
All committee names will be a maximum of 90 characters long.

ORGANIZATION TYPE - ORGANIZATION TYPE
The FEC interest group codes match the boxes on the form exactly.

CANDIDATE NAME - CANDIDATE NAME
All candidate names will be a maximum of 38 characters long.

STREET ADDRESS 1/2 - STREET 1, STREET 2
All street addresses will be a maximum of 34 characters long.

CITY - CITY
All city indicators will be a maximum of 18 characters long.

STATE CODE - STATE / ELECTION STATE
All state indicators will be codes and will be 2 characters long.  State codes referring to addresses will be indicated by STATE, references to the state in which a candidate is running will be referred as ELECTION STATE. 

ZIP CODE - ZIP
All zip codes will be 9 characters long, four trailing spaces are acceptable.

DATES - DATE
All dates will be eight numeric characters.  The dates will be in the format CCYYMMDD .  In this text many dates will be followed by identifiers such as:  DATE (OF CONTRIBUTION).   However, implementation of the “Header Record” will allow for the specification of dates in either CCYYMMDD or MMDDCCYY formats.

AMOUNTS
Amount fields are 12 characters maximum.  They must be numeric (with two exceptions).
A leading minus (-) sign is used to indicate negative amount values.  An explicit decimal
point (.) must be imbedded with 2 numeric decimal positions following the point.
However, implementation of the “Header Record” will allow for the specification of amounts with either explicit decimal point (eg. 999.99, 0.05, -100.00) representation,
or “implicit” decimal representation (eg. 99999, 005, -10000).  With implicit decimal
point representation, the last two (2) digits are interpreted to be cents.

RATES
Interest rates are coded as 4-digit percents (ie. 4 decimal places with/without an explicit decimal point. For example:  .0500 or 0865 are  interpreted as 5% or 8.65%.  The maximum field lenght is 5 bytes.


INDIVIDUAL’S NAMES - IND/NAME
Previously in this document individuals names varied between 38 and 34 characters.  I have changed this so that all individual names are now a maximum of 38 characters.  The original logic was that the disclosure database contains 34 character names.

To accomodate the variety of situations, the following has been implemented for the name field. Each name field may contain the following elements:

Lastname (or Business name)
Firstname (plus all middle initials and/or middle names)
Prefix (such as Dr., Ms. or Mr.)
Suffix (such as Jr., Sr.)

Accordingly, the name field will be sub-delimited with a carrot (^) so that a name field record would appear as follows:

“Lastname^Firstname^Prefix^Suffix”

Some examples follow:

Dr. John W. Smith, Jr. would be shown as: “Smith^John W.^Dr.^Jr.”
Smith Medical Corporation would be: “Smith Medical Corporation”
Jennifer Smith would be “Smith^Jennifer”
Ms. Jennifer T. Smith-Reilly would be “Smith-Reilly^Jennifer T.^Ms.”




INDIVIDUAL’S EMPLOYER - INDEMP
Previously in this document the individual employer field was listed at 34 characters.  I t has been changed  so that all individual employers fields are now a maximum of 38 characters.  The original logic was that the disclosure database contains 35 character names.

INDIVIDUAL’S OCCUPATION - INDOCC
Previously in this document the individual occupation field was listed at 34 characters.  It has been changed  so that all individual occupation fields are now a maximum of 38 characters.  The original logic was that the disclosure database contains 35 character names.

CANDIDATE OFFICE - CAN/OFF
The candidate office field is a one character alpha code;  ‘H’ represents house, ‘S’ represents senate and ‘P’ represents presidential. 

CANDIDATE DISTRICT - CAN/DIST
Candidate districts consist of two numeric characters.  The only acceptable responses are
blank, and 00 through 99.

PARTY DESIGNATIONS - PTY/CODE
Candidates and some committees declare their party affiliations.  This should be a three character code and is optional in all cases.

This implies a lookup table for codes - otherwise, they must be able to enter the full party name.

TITLE - TITLE
All titles will be a maximum of 20 characters long.

TELEPHONE NUMBER - TELEPHONE
Telephone numbers, when reported contain 10 numeric characters.

REPORT CODE - RPTCODE
Report code consists of  three alpha-numeric characters.  The acceptable report codes are included in the FEC codes list.  The FEC may need to add one or two to deal with possible (but never as yet filed) convention reports.

Again, implies a lookup table for codes, or allowance for full name of report.


ELECTION TYPE (REPORTS) - RPTPGI
Election types when referring to the basic reports can only indicate elections within the election cycle that is being reported.  Therefore the only acceptable responses are: ‘ ‘, C, G, P, R, S.

The following is an attempt to make the P/G indicator a 4 character field that will cover all options and be standard vs. maintaining a rambling 20 character description field.
THIS IS AN OPTION, THE ITEMIZED RECORD ALLOWS A P/G INDICATION, THERE IS ALSO AN “O” OPTION THAT GIVES A DESCRIPTION FIELD.  SEE THE SA FORM BELOW.

ELECTION TYPE (ITEMIZED) -   ITEM PG OTHER
In reference to the individual transactions reported on the various schedules election types may indicate elections within the election cycle that is being reported and past and future elections. Therefore the only acceptable responses are: ‘ ‘, C, G, P, R, S as well as years ranging from 1980 to 200*.

In order to keep the file structure consistent with the existing Schedule A and B forms,
and to allow for meaningful Text-on-Graphics reproduction, the following rules are best:

ITEM PG OTHER possible values are “P”, “G”, “O” (and blank if the info is not given)

PG OTHER DESCRIP must be given when ITEM PG OTHER = “O” and must be
Convention, Runoff, Special, or a year from 1980+.  At least the first character must be
“C”, “R”, “S” or the first 4 characters must be numeric >= 1980.


CONVENTION COMMITTEE TYPE - CONVENTION TYPE
Form 4 gives a selection for type of convention committee.  The choices are; Arrangements, Host and Other.  Included is  a 40 character area for a description of the ‘Other’.

SEQUENCE NUMBER - SEQUENCE NUMBER
In the schedules the format calls for a user generated sequence number, this number is to be used to identify transactions especially for amendments.


COMMUNICATION COSTS SUPPORT/OPPOSE - 24F24N
Communication costs may be reported on Schedule SB, and Form 7.   On the Form 7 I identify the support/oppose difference on the Form 7 as 24F24N, these being the only acceptable entries in the field.  Data representation in the records will be “S” or “O”.
Data translation when loading the FEC database will be done by equating ‘S’ = ‘24F’ and
‘O’ = ‘24N’.

INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES SUPPORT/OPPOSE - 24A24E
Communication costs may be reported on Schedule SB, Schedule E and Form 5.   On the Form 5 and Schedule E  I identify the support/oppose difference as 24A24E, these being the only acceptable entries in the field.  Data representation in the records will be “S” or “O”.  Data translation when loading the FEC database will be done by equating ‘S’ = ‘24E’ and ‘O’ = ‘24A’  (or is it the other way around?).

TYPE OF RECEIPT - RECEIPTCODE
Schedule SA’s layout contains both a receipt code field and a transaction description field.  One or the other of the fields are optional however one must be entered.  The transaction may further described in the Memo field.

TYPE OF DISBURSEMENT - DISBURSECODE
Schedule SB’s layout contains both a disbursement code field and a transaction description field.  One or the other of the fields are optional however one must be entered.  The transaction may further described in the Memo field.

PLEASE NOTE:  ADDITIONAL TRANSACTION CODE FIELDS WILL BE ADDED TO THE RECORD LAYOUTS.  IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT MOST ‘DESCRIPTION’ FIELDS WILL BE GIVEN A CORRESPONDING THREE CHARACTER CODE FIELD. 

PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION - TRANSDESC
A description of  itemized transactions maximum 40 characters.

DESCRIPTION FIELD - DESC
There are many general text fields that will be required throughout these forms and Schedules.  Many are in response to the YESNO (below) questions on the forms.  The DESC fields range from 20 to 300 maximum characters.


MEMO ENTRY	EXPLANATION - MEMO
Many  itemized transactions will have a Memo entry to allow the filers to provide a more complete description of the activity.  Maximum 100 characters.  Memo Text will
be available on itemized amounts on Schedules A and B - amounts which are totaled and
carried back to the Summary Page of the filing.  In addition a Memo Code indicates that
the amount is NOT to be included in the itemization total.

YES/NO BOXES - YESNO
Several Forms and Schedules contain yes/no boxes, the questions are generally different for each form and can determine the need for further response in another field.

Unless otherwise noted, Check Boxes are evaluated to be “checked” or “empty” based on the data content of the related field in the Comma-Separated-Value (CSV) file.

Box = “Checked” when CSV value is “X”, “Y”, “1” or “T”  (value “X” is preferred)
Box = “Empty” when CSV value is blank, “N”, “0” or “F”    (space or null is preferred)

AMENDED RECORD - AMENDED
Each applicable schedule contains an “Amended” field. This field is to be used to indicate which records constitute “amended” records.
Values:	“A” = New (Added) Record
	“C” = Changed Record
	“D” = Deleted Record
