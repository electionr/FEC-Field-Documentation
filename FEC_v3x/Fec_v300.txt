OVERVIEW

This document describes the filing format used for electronically submitting disclosure and registration documents to the Federal Election Commission.  (A related MS Excel spreadsheet named "FEC_v300.xls" describes the specific layouts for the records that are used in electronic document files.)

The format consists of various record layouts whose fields are separated (delimited) by commas.  CSV (comma-separated-value) files are made up of records which are delimited with terminating CRLF (carridge-return and line-feed characters - represented in hexidecimal as '0D0A'.)  Each comma within a CSV record represents the end of one field and the beginning of the next.  Any text which might contain a comma (used as punctuation) must be surrounded with double-quote marks (eg. "text, and more text").

Fields may not begin with leading blanks (for example, "  ABC" is incorrectly coded and should be coded "ABC").  Generally speaking, only keyboard characters are acceptable within CSV files.  Technically, any coded characters that fall outside the range of ASCII characters 32 (space) through 126 (tilde "~") will be rejected.  Care should be taken if
text is cut and pasted from word processing programs, since some characters such as appostrophe and "smart quotes" may not translate into the appropriate ASCII characters.

The first record of every electronic file that is submitted to the FEC must be an HDR record that precedes the main body of the ASCII CSV (comma separated values) data.
The second record will be a "cover" record for the particular filing, (for example, a F3 or and F3X record for a FEC-3 or FEC-3X electronic report).  An unlimited number of Schedule records (examples: SA, SB, SC/, ...) can follow the first two records of an FEC electronic report file.  (Electronic files are usually assigned the file suffix ".fec".)

A validating utility named FECheck4 is available for downloading from the FEC website.
It can, and should, be used by everyone who creates electronic files for the FEC, especially by those who are testing new software to create electronic filings.  The same validatating utility is used by the FEC to check every electronic filing that it receives, either by diskette or over the internet.




    GENERAL REQUIREMENTS


FORM TYPE
FORM TYPE refers to the combination of the FEC form and other important identifying indicators.  For the general forms (cover sheets, not schedules), the format is form type followed by the amendment indicator (e.g. F3A, F3PA).  If a filing is not an amendment and not a termination report, it is a "New Report" and the 'N' indicator is included in the Form Type (e.g. F3XN).  If the Report Type is indicated as a “Termination Report”, a ‘T’ indicator will be included in the Form Type (for quick identification purposes) UNLESS the ‘A’ amendment indicator supersedes the ‘T’ indicator.

Form types for schedules are a little more complicated - they indicate both the schedule and the line from the Summary Page of the cover form that the record relates to (e.g.  SA15A).


FEC ID NUMBER - (FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER, FEC CANDIDATE ID NUMBER)
All references to “FEC ID NUMBER” indicate that the field contains a FEC assigned identification number.  All committee ID numbers begin with a ‘C’ and all candidate ID numbers begin with: S (senate), H (house), P (presidential).  All FEC id numbers are 9 characters long with no spaces.

House & Senate Candidate FEC ID codes have the following formats:  H9ST99999, S9ST99999, and P99999999...  (where the 1st Character is H=House, S=Senate, P=Presidential, and the 3rd & 4th characters of House & Senate codes are the 2-letter State Code, and the remaining parts of all codes are numeric).

Committee FEC ID codes consist of the letter  C=Committee in the first position, followed by 7 digits, followed by a 'check-digit' in the 9th position.

This document has been changed to include more detail and to insure consistency.
For example, in Form 1, the line:
	2.   FILER FEC CMTE ID			(A/N-9)
	 (reflects that only committees will file the document.)

Please note, certain lines will have identifying words included; these exist only to aid in identifying the type of committee included in the field.  For example:
	FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER  (PCC)		(A/N-9)
	FEC COMMITTEE ID NUMBER  (AUTH)		(A/N-9)


COMMITTEE NAME - COMMITTEE NAME
All committee names are a maximum of 90 characters long.


ORGANIZATION TYPE - ORGANIZATION TYPE
The FEC interest group codes match the boxes on the form exactly.
Options are: ‘C’, ‘T’, ‘L’, ‘M’, ‘V’, ‘W’.   (also see Appendix)


CANDIDATE NAME - CANDIDATE NAME
All candidate names are a maximum of 38 characters long.


STREET ADDRESS 1/2 - STREET 1, STREET 2
All street addresses are a maximum of 34 characters long.
If only one line of street address is given, it should be coded in Street 1, and Street 2 should be blank.



CITY - CITY
All city indicators are a maximum of 18 characters long.


STATE CODE - STATE / ELECTION STATE
All state indicators are 2 character codes.  The Appendix includes a listing of  special state codes.  State codes referring to addresses are indicated by STATE, references to the state in which a candidate is running are referred to as ELECTION STATE. 


ZIP CODE - ZIP
All zip codes are 9 characters long, four trailing spaces are acceptable.


DATES - DATE
All dates are eight numeric characters.  The dates are in the format CCYYMMDD.  In this document, many dates are followed by identifiers such as:  DATE (OF CONTRIBUTION).


AMOUNTS
Amount fields are 12 characters maximum.  They must be numeric (with two exceptions).  A leading minus (-) sign is used to indicate negative amount values.  An explicit decimal point (.) must be imbedded with 2 numeric decimal positions following the point.  However, implementation of the “Header Record”  allows for the specification of amounts with either explicit decimal point (e.g. 999.99, 0.05, -100.00) representation,  or “implicit” decimal representation (e.g. 99999, 005, -10000).  With implicit decimal  point representation, the last two (2) digits are interpreted to be cents.


RATES
Interest rates are generally coded as numeric amounts, however up to 15 characters of text is acceptable on Schedule C, where rates can be expressed in terms such as “Prime + 1%” for example.  If the rate is expressed as a percentage then it must be coded as a 4-digit percent (i.e. 4 decimal places with an explicit, leading decimal point).  For example: .0500 or .0865 are interpreted as 5% or 8.65%.  A value of 100% must be expressed as a rate with a coded value of 1.000.
The maximum field length for “text” rates is 15 bytes.
The minimum/maximum field length for numeric rates is exactly 5 bytes.



INDIVIDUAL’S NAMES - IND/NAME
All individual names are a maximum of 38 characters.  
To accommodate the variety of situations, the following has been implemented for the name field. Each name field may contain the following elements:
	Lastname (or Business name)
	Firstname (plus all middle initials and/or middle names)
	Prefix (such as Dr., Ms. or Mr.)
	Suffix (such as Jr., Sr.)

Accordingly, the name field is sub-delimited with a caret (^) so that a name field record would appear as follows:
	“Lastname^Firstname^Prefix^Suffix”

Some examples follow:
Dr. John W. Smith, Jr. would be shown as: “Smith^John W.^Dr.^Jr.”
John W. Smith, Jr. would be shown as: “Smith^John W.^^Jr.”
Smith Medical Corporation would be: “Smith Medical Corporation”
Ms. Jennifer T. Smith-Reilly would be “Smith-Reilly^Jennifer T.^Ms.”

Note:  An alternate character to the caret(^) name delimiter may be defined by including the alternate delimiter in the Header Record.


INDIVIDUAL’S EMPLOYER - INDEMP
All individual employers fields are now a maximum of 38 characters. 


INDIVIDUAL’S OCCUPATION - INDOCC
Previously in this document the individual occupation field was listed at 34 characters.  It has been changed  so that all individual occupation fields are now a maximum of 38 characters.  The original logic was that the disclosure database contains 35 character names.


CANDIDATE OFFICE - CAN/OFF
The candidate office field is a one character alpha code;  ‘H’ represents house, ‘S’ represents senate, and ‘P’ represents presidential. 


CANDIDATE DISTRICT - CAN/DIST
Candidate districts consist of two numeric characters.  The only acceptable responses are
blank, and 00 through 99.


PARTY DESIGNATIONS - PTY/CODE
Candidates and some committees declare their party affiliations.  This should be a three character code and is optional in all cases.  A full list of these party codes is included in the Appendix.


TELEPHONE NUMBER - TELEPHONE
Telephone numbers, when reported contain 10 numeric characters.



REPORT CODE - RPTCODE
Report code consists of  three alpha-numeric characters.  The acceptable report codes are included in the Appendix. 


ELECTION TYPE (COVER FORMS / REPORTS) - RPTPGI
Election types, when referring to the basic reports, can only indicate elections within the election cycle that is being reported.  Therefore the only acceptable responses are: ‘C’, ‘G’, ‘P’, ‘R’, ‘S’.  A full list of these codes is listed in the Appendix. 


ELECTION TYPE (ITEMIZED / SCHEDULES) - ITEM-ELECT-CD
In reference to the individual transactions reported on the various schedules, election types indicate elections within the election cycle that is being reported and past and future elections.   See Appendix.
If Other is coded, the ITEM-ELECT-OTHER description must also be coded.


CONVENTION COMMITTEE TYPE -CONVENTION TYPE
Form 4 gives a selection for type of convention committee.  The choices are: Arrangements, Host and Other.  Included is a 40 character area for a description of the “Other”.


COMMUNICATION COSTS SUPPORT/OPPOSE - 24F/24N
Communication costs may be reported on Form 7.   The support/oppose value is identified as 24F and 24N on the FEC's database.  Data may be represented by either the 24F/24N values or with S/O coding.  Data translation is done by equating ‘S’ with ‘24F’ and  ‘O’ with ‘24N’.


INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES SUPPORT/OPPOSE - 24A/24E
Communication costs may be reported on Schedule E and Form 5.   The support/oppose value is identified as 24A and 24E on the FEC's database.  Data may be represented by either the 24A/24E values or with S/O coding.  Data translation is done by equating ‘S’ with ‘24E’ and ‘O’ with ‘24A’.


MEMO ENTRY- MEMO
Many  itemized transactions have a Memo entry to allow the filers to provide a more complete description of the activity.  Maximum 100 characters.  Memo Text is available on itemized amounts on Schedules A and B - amounts which are totaled and carried back to the Summary Page of the filing.  In addition a Memo Code indicates that the amount is NOT to be included in the itemization total.


YES/NO BOXES - YESNO
Several Forms and Schedules contain yes/no boxes, the questions are generally different for each form and can determine the need for further response in another field.  Unless otherwise noted, Check Boxes are evaluated to be “checked” or “empty” based on the data content of the related field in the Comma-Separated-Value (CSV) file.
Box = “Checked” when CSV value is ‘X’, ‘Y’, ‘1’ or ‘T’ (value ‘X’ is preferred)
Box = “Empty” when CSV value is blank, ‘N’, ‘0’ or ‘F’    (space or null is preferred)




TRANSACTION IDENTIFIERS (TRAN_ID)
Transaction Identifiers {TRAN_ID} are required on every schedule itemization record.  

For all new items, the TRAN_ID must contain a unique value that will be used by the Agency's database to point to that particular item.  It must be a value that is unique among all items within a group of reports comprised of an original and all associated amendments. 

Tran ID: A unique identifier permanently associated with each itemization or transaction appearing in an FEC electronic file. If a given itemization appears in more than one schedule (e.g.  an in-kind contribution is reported on both Schedule A and Schedule B) then the Tran ID associated with that itemization must have different values for that single item among the various schedules. However, all Tran Ids of itemizations appearing in any amending report must match the Tran Ids first used for those same itemizations in the original report. 

The Tran ID assigned and maintained by the filer's software is used by the FEC's database to uniquely identify each itemization from every filer. It is critically important that when a filer amends a previously filed electronic report, the Tran Ids of the subsequent amendment match those already reported. It is acceptable for a Tran ID of one original report to be assigned a value that was used on a previous original report and all of its amendments.



HEADER  RECORDS


The first record of every electronic file that is submitted to the FEC must be an HDR record that precedes the main body of the ASCII CSV (comma separated values) data.  An example of Version 3.00 header records for an FEC filing is shown below. 

Example of a Header Record:

					
Seq.  Field Desc	Type 	 Rule Reference

01  	Record Type	A/N-3	 Record Type. Value: HDR
02 	EF Type	A/N-3	 Electronic Filing Type   Value: FEC
03 	FEC Ver	A/N-4	 FEC Version #. Value: 3.00
04 	Soft Name	A/N-90 Filer software name
05 	Soft Ver	A/N-16 Filer Software Version #
06	Name Delim	A-1	 Internal delimiter used in Name fields. 
 Default is “^”
07  	Rpt ID	A/N-16 If Amendment, FEC Report ID assigned to orig.
08 	Rpt Number	N-03	 If Amendment, the number (1-999) of the 
 amending Report starting with Amendment #1 
 through #999





MEMOS NOTES & EXPLANATORY TEXT


Large bodies of text can be associated with forms, schedules and also with individual itemizations within schedules.  A special TEXT record can be used in an FEC file to carry descriptive text as a string of characters not exceeding 4000 characters.  

TEXT records can be associated with a filing's "cover" page, with a schedule/line number combination, and to one or more individual itemizations within a schedule. When the text record is related to an itemized transaction, it does not replace the “Description/Purpose of Disbursement” field. The text record is  for reporting extra information beyond the required short description.



The layout of the TEXT record is described below:

SEQ

002  	Travel Expenses - including travel reimbursement expenses 
(e.g., costs of commercial carrier tickets; reimbursements for use of private vehicles, advance payments for use of corporate aircraft; lodging and meal expenses incurred during travel)

* Amend Code is still used in an original report to indicate an amended employer or occupation. This requires an “X” in the Memo Code field as well.

Amendment Processing is easier for Filers to comply with:

Amend Code on all Schedules is no longer required or used in an amended filing.  The need for vendor supplied (and in-house written) filing software to track changes on an item-by-item basis over time has been eliminated.  The"AMENDED CD" fields on Schedules (SA, SB, SC/, SD, SE, SF, H1, H2, H3, H4, I, F56, F57, F65, F76, F82 and F83) has been left in the Version 3.0 layout specification.  However, these "Add/Change/Delete" codes are unnecessary and the field is ignored..

When a report is filed as an "Amendment", the Report is still identified with an "A" appended to the "Form
Type".  For example an F3 filed as an amendment is coded as an F3A.  In addition, the FEC database identifier of the "Original" report is supplied in the "Report Ident" field of the new "HDR" record and the sequential number of the Amendment (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ... 999) is supplied in the "Report Number" field in the new "HDR" record.

New reports may include Memo items that carry a “C” in the amend code to indicate amended employer and occupation information.


New Header format

			Max 
 #	Field Name	Length	Description
01	Record Type	    3	Record Type.  Value: HDR
02	EF Type		    3	Electronic Filing Type  Value: FEC
03	FEC Version	    4	FEC Version #.  Value: 3.00
04	Software Name	  90	Filer Software Name
05	Software Vers	  16	Filer Software Version #
06	Name Delim	    1	Internal delimiter used in Name fields. Default is  ' ^ '
07	Report Ident	  16	If Amendment, FEC's Report ID assigned to Original.
08	Report Number	    3	If Amendment, the number (1-999) of the Amending
Report starting with Amendment #1 through #999.

In previous versions, the header was not part of the comma-delimited section of the .FEC file. For version 3.00, the header is a comma-delimited record that must be the first record in a filing.  It is identified with
"HDR" in the first position, followed by "FEC" in the second position in the CSV record.

 It serves the same purpose as the previous Version 2.02 Header  (the /* Header section that was created by the FEConGen utility program) but is much easier to construct and no longer contains information that can otherwise be derived or is carried elsewhere within the .FEC electronic reporting file.

Numerous fields are no longer needed in the new "HDR" record.  Schedule counts and the control-number
are not needed.  The integrity of a filing is confirmed by the MD5 check-sum processing during the upload
process and the cross-checking of Summary Page totals against Schedule totals by the Validation program provides additional confirmation that a received filing is complete. 

The Date_Fmat and Dec_NoDec options have been removed from the Header Record.  All Dates must be in a "ccyymmdd" format.  Amounts can be coded with or without an explicit decimal point (however, when a decimal point is included in an amount, it must be followd by no more than two decimal places).

The Committee Name and  Committee's FEC ID# are no longer carried in the "Header" because they are
always carried in the "Cover" record which immediately follows the HDR record.

Two new fields have been added to the new "HDR" record layout which were not defined in the previous
"Header" section.  A "Report Identifier" representing the FEC database identifier for an "original" report
is used when an "amendment to the original" is filed.  Also, Amendment reports are assigned an incremental "Amendment Number" which is coded in the new "Report Number" field (an Original report
is Report Number "Zero" - the Report Number can be coded with '0' or it can be left blank on Originals).

Four fields have been retained in the new "HDR" that were also in the Version 2.02 "Header" section.  They are:  FEC format Version #; Filing Software Name; Filing Software Version #; and the Name Delimiter (the character such as ' ^ ' used to separate parts of a person's name in all NAME fields).



Email and Web URL fields for Form F1

The format for Form F1 now includes a 90-character field for email address and a 90 character field for web URL. Electronic filers that have web sites and email addresses are required to provide them.  These two new fields are added to the end of the F1 layout.  Prior fields in the F1 layout are unchanged.

Multiple Accounts and Related/Associated Committees on Form 1

To report multiple accounts or related committees on Form 1, re[prt the first account and related committee in the F1N (new) or F1A (amended) record. Use F1S records for subsequent accounts and committees until all have been accounted for. Each F1s has the same required information as the F1N or F1A even though it has already been reported.

Election indicator changed to comply with cycle-to-date reporting requirements

The election indicator field has been increased from “A/N-1” to “A/N-5” and should be reported in the format  [single letter report indicator][ccyy]. For example, Primary 2002 should be reported as “P2002”. The forms, schedules and fields affected are:

F3, F3P, F3X, F5, F76 	– RPTPGI 
SA, SB 			– ITEM ELECT CD
SC 			– ELECTION



Text  Records

Text records have been added to the format to allow large amounts of text to be included in a filing. The text may be related to the Filing itself (one occurrence per filing related to the "Cover" page).  It may be related to a Schedule/Summary Page line number (one occurrence per schedule/summary page line number) or to one or more Itemized Transactions (one per any/each itemized transaction).

#	Field Name	Length	Description
1	Record Type	      4	Record Type.  Value: TEXT

2	Form Type	      8	Contains Form Type of a "cover" Form (F3N, F3XA, ...) or of a
 				Schedule ( SA11A1, SA11B, SB17, ...) to which this text is related.

3	Tran ID Ref	    20	The value of a "Tran ID" if the text is linked to a specific itemization
 				within a Schedule (otherwise this field is left blank).

4	Text4000	4000	A string of unformatted text up to 4000 characters.
 				(Note:  no tab, carriage return, line feed or any other non-printable
characters may be embedded within the string of text.)



New F99 Filing Type for unstructured, formatted text

A new Form called an F99 has been devised to allow filers to submit letters, memos, and other text documents electronically.  As in other filings (e.g. F3, F3X, ... etc.) there is a "Cover" sheet followed
by text.  The HDR and the F99 "cover" records are CSV records (as are all other kinds of electronic filings to the FEC).

#	Field Name			Length	Description
1	FORM TYPE			A/N-3	Form Type Value: "F99"
2	FILER FEC CMTE ID		A/N-9	Filing Committee ID  Example: C98765431
3	COMMITTEE NAME       	A/N-90  Filing Committee's Name
4	STREET 1			A/N-34  Committee's Street Address 1
5	STREET 2			A/N-34	Committee's Street Address 2
6	CITY				A/N-18  Committee's City/Town
7	STATE				A-2	Committee's State Code
8	ZIP				A/N-9	Committee's Zip Code
9	NAME/TREASURER (as signed)	A/N-38	Treasurer Name	
10	DATE (Signed)			NUM-8	Signature Date


The F99 filing provides a mechanism where the filer can send "formatted" text.  This means that the
text can contain Carriage Return & Line-feed characters along with TAB characters.  

The text in a F99 filing is coded between two delimiter records:  a [BeginText] record and an [EndText] record.  The following example shows how an F99 filing is coded:

HDR,FEC,3.00,Super Filer,Ver 1.0
F99,C98765431,"Friends of Pat","123 Sycamore St",,"Anytown",FL,33034
[BeginText]
This is an example of something that a filer might want to send to the FEC.  There
are a few lines of text followed by some columns of information.

Line		Description		Amount
----		-----------		------
  1		Line One		  1.00
  2		Line Two		 20.00
  3		Line Three		300.00

The table above means nothing, but serves as an example of how a filer could send something electronically to the FEC and have the document tracked in the same way that any other kind of filing would be tracked.

Back Ref ID and Back Ref Sched Name

In order to clarify relationships between transactions, a Back Reference ID has been created to carry the Tran ID of the related transaction and a Back Reference Schedule Name has been added to indicate the schedule that contains the related transaction.

Affected forms and schedules: SA, SB, SE, SF, SH4

Rules for Applying the Back Reference Fields:

If there is a one-to-many relationship between transactions, the many carry the tran id of the one in the back ref tran ID field and the Schedule of the one in the back Ref Sched Name field.  In cases such as credit card payments,  the one to many model holds even though there may be one child record or many child records  to relate to the parent  record.

	Example: Partnerships (reported on Schedule A for line 11a on form 3)
The receipt form the partnership has nothing in the two back reference fields.
Each partner’s receipt has the tran ID of the Partnership transaction in the Back Ref Tran ID field and “SA11A” in the back Ref Sched Name field.

If there is a one-to-one relationship between the related transactions, the transactions are ranked chronologically. The first is the parent record and contains nothing in the back Reference Fields and the second is the child record and contains the parent transaction’s tran ID and Schedule name in the Back Reference fields.

Example: In-Kind  receipt.
The in-kind receipt is the parent because it occurs prior to the in-kind disbursement that is created to balance the totals. The Receipt has nothing in the back reference fields. The disbursement carries the tran ID and sched name of the receipt in the back reference fields.
Special cases
Loans (Schedule A) and Loan repayments (Schedule B) are child records of the Schedule C record and carry its Tran ID and Sched name in the back reference fields.
Debts  and Debt Payments (Both Schedule B and H4) are Child records of the Schedule D record and carry its Tran ID and Sched Name in the back reference fields.

Other examples are:

Partnership Receipt 	linking to 	Partner memos
Credit card Payment 	inking to 	Vendor payment memos
Earmarked receipts 	linking to 	earmarked disbursements
In-kind receipts 		linking to 	in-kind disbursements
Joint fundraising receipts 	linked to 	fundraising committee and to contributing committee
H4 disbursement memo 	linked to 	Schedule E, F or B23 transaction




Special Summary records for  reports crossing election periods

To support the new regulation requiring Form 3 and Form 3P to report with cycle-to-date aggregation and itemization, a new record has been created for filings that cover date ranges beginning in one cycle and ending in another (30G or YE in an election year). The F3S or F3PS record is used to report the “column B” summary information for the portion of the report that begins after the election day. The transactions that occur on or prior to election-day are reported in the F3 or F3P record as “Column B” amounts.  Essentially, this is a report with three summary columns.  “Column A” contains all information for the current reporting period regardless of whether it occurs before or after the election. “Column B1” includes Cycle-to-date figures from the beginning of the cycle through election day and “Column B2” contains Cycle-to-date figures that begin the day after the election (beginning of the new cycle) and end with the last day of the reporting period. Individual aggregates and itemizations within the report will be based on whether they occur before or after the election.  It is "Column B2" which is coded on the new F3S and F3PS records for F3 and F3P filings respectively. F3S and F3PS should only be included in 30G reports in an election year for campaigns that are involved in the General election, or the Year End report in an election year for Campaigns that are not involved in the general election.






New F24 Filing Type for 24-hour Expenditure reports

A new Form called an F24 has been devised to allow filers to submit last-minute, 24-hour expenditure reports electronically.  As in other filings (e.g. F3, F3X, ... etc.) there is a "Cover" sheet followed
by one or more 'SE24' schedules.

#	Field Name			Length	Description

Version 1.02 Format to Version 2.02 Format


List of Schedules with changes:

Schedules:  SA, SB, SC, SC1, SD, SE, SF, SH1, SH2, SH3, SH4, & SI.

Form "schedule-like" multiple occurrence records:  F3P31AL, F56, F57, F65, F76, F8II, and F8III.

(Note:  Forms such as F3 and F3X have not changed in Ver 2.02 from the definitions in Ver 1.02.)



New record type for Schedule SC2.

Schedule C is now coded with record types SC/, SC1/, and SC2/.  SC2/ is new and allows for coding multiple guarantor information with a Schedule C loan description.



General Description of modifications and enhancements

An Entity Type is used to "classify" contributors, payees, lenders, etc.  Primarily, it is used to indicate if the entity is a person {with first & last names} or an organization.  Sometimes the organization must be further identified as to whether it is a Candidate Committee, PAC, Political Party etc.

Although Entity Type is still an optional field, it will likely become a required field sometime in the future.


Amendment Codes {AMEND_CD} are used on all schedules.  On original filings, the Amendment Code should be blank {but may contain A = Add}.

If a filing is an amendment to an earlier "original" filing, every schedule itemization must contain one of 4 values:
	A = Add {a new item}
	C = Change {the original item}
	D = Delete {the original item}
	N = No Change {to the original item}


Transaction Identifiers {TRAN_ID} are required on every schedule itemization.

For all new items, the TRAN_ID must contain a unique value that will be used by the FEC database to point to that particular item.  It must be a value that is unique among all items filed by that committee.

For all amending items {Changes, Deletes, Non-changes}, the TRAN_ID must already exist on the FEC database from a prior filing.



Conduit Name & Address has been added to Receipts and Expenditure Schedules {A, B, D, E, F, H4, F3P31AL, F56, F57, and F65.


Name fields maximums (on schedules such as SA, SB, etc.) have been increased to A/N-90 to allow for Organization/Committee names.  However, if a person's name is given {indicated by Entity Type or the name is delimited into last, first, prefix, suffix}, the name cannot exceed 38 characters {including spaces}.  This enhancement allows for the removal of the redundant Name/Address fields that were used for Committees on Version 1.02 Schedule A and B record layouts.

{Samples}.FEC  Samples ".FEC" files are included as examples of electronic 
               files.  They can be run through FECheck4 to assist developers 
               in getting familiar with the program.  





The DOS version of FECHECK4 is run from the DOS command line.

Syntax:  FECHECK4 [c:\path\filename[.FEC]]

Notes:   The .FEC need not be coded but will be assumed if not 
         specified.  FECHECK4 displays the number of warnings and
         errors that are encountered.  Messages are written to a
         '.MSG' file on the same drive/directory as the '.FEC' file.
         FECHECK4 will prompt the user if the file spec is not
         included on the command line.

         Normally FECHECK4 will list an unlimited number of error
         messages (if there are any) at various levels of severity.
         Level 12 errors are the "most severe" while  Level 8's
         are "less severe".  Neither will be accepted by the FEC.
         Level 4 messages should not occur, however, filings with
         messages (non of which exceed Level 4) may be conditionally
         accepted by the FEC.  An filer can choose to limit the
         number of Level 4, 8 and 12 errors that will be listed by
         setting limits in the FECHECK4.INI file.

         The "Unformat_MS2" parameter is used to indicate if a '.MS2'
         file is to be created along with the '.MSG' file.  The '.MS2'
         file contains the same information that is written to the 
         formatted '.MSG' file, but as comma-delimited CSV text file.

	  The layout of the comma-delimited '.ms2' file is:

1) Form Name (eg. F3N, F3XA, SA111, SB17, ...);
2) Tran_ID of an Itemization in a Schedule;
3) Identifying Name of an Itemization in a Schedule;
4) Column # {refer to .xls spreadsheet} of Field in Error;
5) Descriptive name of the Field in Error;
6) Error Level (04, 08, 12, or 16);
7) Error Message.

         The "TID_Errs_MS3" parameter is used to request that FECHECK4
         create a '.MS3' file along with the '.MSG' formatted error file.
         This third message file lists the schedules & Tran_IDs of 
         itemizations that are found to have errors.  It can be used by
         vendor software to highlight the transactions that have 
         something that is causing a validation error.


         The FECHECK4.INI file can be edited with a text editor.

         Default settings of the FECHECK4.INI file:

         Level_4_Msg_Limit =         {no parameter means unlimited}
         Level_8_Msg_Limit =         {no parameter means unlimited}
         Level_12_Msg_Limit =        {no parameter means unlimited}
         Unformat_MS2 = No
         TID_Errs_MS3 = No





The Windows version of FECHECK4.DLL can be called from a Windows
program.  The following sample code is used to call FECHECK4 in 
Visual Basic.  Three parameters are passed from the VB program to
FECHECK4.DLL, which returns 2-byte binary (Integer) "Error Level".
"Error Count" is "passed by reference" so that it be evaluated after
the call.

  1) string containing "c:\path\filename.FEC"  (FEC's CSV file)
  2) string containing "c:\path\filename.MSG"  (Message file)
  3) 2-byte binary "Integer"                   (Error Count)
  4) returning a 2-byte binary "Integer"       (Return Code/Err Level)


Sample Visual Basic code for calling FECHECK4.DLL:

  ' Global declarations

    Declare Function                     - (continued on next line)
      FECHECK4 Lib "FECHECK4.DLL"        - (continued on next line)
      (ByVal FECfile As String,          - (continued on next line)
       ByVal MSGfile As String,          - (continued on next line)
       ErrCount As Integer) As Integer

  ' Code in the VB form ...

    Dim InFileFEC As String, OutFileMSG As String
    Dim ErrCount As Integer, ErrLevel As Integer

    InFileFEC = "d:\path\filename.FEC"     ' FEC File
    OutFileMSG = "d:\path\filename.MSG"    ' Messages File
 
    ErrLevel = FECHECK4(InFileFEC, OutFileMSG, ErrCount)

  ' Note: Possible ErrLevel values are: 0, 4, 8, 12.

    If ErrLevel > 0 Then
       If ErrCount = 0 Then
  '      (call to FECHECK4 failed: d:\path filename invalid?)
  '      (Note: ErrLevel will = 12 in this case.)
       Else
  '      (processing when ErrCount validation errors are found)
  '      (Note: FEC will conditionally accept when ErrLevel = 4)
       End If
    Else
  '   (processing when FEC file passes validation with no errors)
  '   (Note: ErrCount will = 0 in this case.)
    End If



Note:  if either a '.MS2' or '.MS3' file is desired, the message file
       name passed in parameter #2 must end with the '.MSG' suffix.


Note:  The FECHECK4.INI file (described above in Running FECheck4.exe in DOS)
should reside in the same directory as the FECHECK4.DLL (or the \Windows
directory) if any non-defalut settngs are desired in your application.



Calling FECHECK4.DLL from Windows C/C++ applications:

FECHECK4 exports a single function:

  short FECHECK4(const char* FECfile, const char* MSGfile, short* p_ErrCount);

There is no import library provided with FECHECK4.DLL, and FECHECK4() 
is typically called as shown below: 

  typedef short (WINAPI * FECHKPROC)(const char*, const char*, short*);

  HINSTANCE hLibFECHK = LoadLibrary("FECHECK4.DLL");
  FECHKPROC validate = (FECHKPROC)GetProcAddress(hLibFECHK, "FECHECK4");

  ...

  short ErrCount;
  short errorLevel = validate("data.FEC", "msg.txt", &ErrCount);

  /*
     At this point :
     - 'ErrCount' holds the number of errors in "data.FEC"
     - 'errorLevel' holds the level of the most severe error
     - the disk file "msg.txt" contains a complete error listing
  */

  ...

  FreeLibrary(hLibFECHK);



  Note: In 16-bit applications it may be necessary to explicitly 
        load the run-time support library CBLSSEG.DLL, before 
        calling FECHECK4.  Obviously CBLSSEG.DLL should be 
        freed once FECHECK4 processing is complete.  



The DOS version of MD5 is run from the DOS command line.

Syntax:  MD5 < [c:\path\filename.FEC]

Notes:   The "<" MUST be included on the command line so that
         MD5 uses "translate" mode while reading the file.
         Translate mode changes all CR-LF pairs into single LF
         characters, matching the way text files are handled
         on Unix based systems.  MD5 does not assume that the
         suffix is .FEC when it is not explicitly entered.


The Windows version of MD5_32.DLL can be called from a Windows
program.  The following sample code is used to call MD5_32 in 
Visual Basic.  Two parameters are passed from the VB program to
MD5_32.DLL.

  1) string containing "c:\path\filename.FEC"  (FEC's CSV file)
  2) string in which a 32-character "Check Sum" is returned.

Sample Visual Basic code for calling MD5_32.DLL:

  ' Global declarations

    Declare Sub                       - (continued on next line)
       MD5 Lib "MD5_32.DLL"           - (continued on next line)
      (ByVal FECfile As String, ByVal CheckSum As String)

  ' Code in the VB form ...

    Dim FECfile As String,
    Dim CheckSum As String * 33    ' CheckSum string MUST be 33 characters)

    FECfile = "d:\path\filename.FEC" & Chr$(0)  ' File with null terminator
    CheckSum = Chr$(0)

    Call MD5(FECfile, CheckSum)    ' Call MD5_32.DLL to generate a CheckSum

  ' Note: CheckSum will be 32-characters with a null terminator in Pos 33.
  '     [ Reference CheckSum in VB by specifying Left$(CheckSum, 32) ]




Notes for C++ programmers about including RSA's MD5 checksum program within applications:

  MD5_32.DLL is a '32-bit' DLL, suitable for Windows 95 / NT 
  developers. 

  The MD5_... DLLs each export a single function, MD5(), that 
  computes a 256-bit 'MD5 checksum' for a specified (ASCII) data 
  file.  

  The prototype for MD5() is in MDUTIL.H, which should be #include'd 
  in code that calls MD5(). The preprocessor variable WIN32 should 
  be defined before including MDUTIL.H in 32-bit code. The 
  preprocessor variable BUILD_MD5_DLL should *always* be undefined.  

  Upon entry to MD5(), 'data_file' should point to a zero-terminated 
  string that is the name of the file for which the MD5 checksum is 
  to be computed. 'ascii_digest' should point to a valid memory 
  block that is at least 33 bytes long.  

  MD5() returns the 256-bit MD5 checksum for 'data_file' in 
  'ascii_digest', as a zero-terminated string. Each byte of the
  'ascii_digest' is the ASCII representation of a single hexadecimal 
  digit in the checksum.  

  MDUTIL.H is a header file for inclusion in C++ source code that 
  calls MD5_32.DLL. The preprocessor variable WIN32 should be defined
  before including MDUTIL.H in 32-bit code.  The preprocessor variable
  DLL_MD5_BUILD should *always* be undefined.  


  Example :
  -------

    char ascii_digest[33];

    if (::MD5("filename.ext", ascii_digest))
    {
      // 'ascii_digest' contains the checksum for "filename.ext"
    }
    else
    {
      // unable to open "filename.ext"
    }
